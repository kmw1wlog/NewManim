# Sample Video Placeholder

The example video `output.mp4` has been removed from version control to keep the repository light.

To try the video player:

1. Generate a sample clip with [Manim](https://docs.manim.community/):
   ```bash
   manim path/to/scene.py SampleScene -o output.mp4
   ```
2. Or place any MP4 file here and name it `output.mp4`.

This directory and file act as placeholders so tooling expecting the sample video can still run.
